Teamname: Sprucelings

Project Name: SpruceCity

Github link: https://github.com/JolieNgai/IP-Project 

Design Process:
Our main idea is to create a educational website where users are able to learn and pick up basic knowledge of certain hobbies.
Our website is not targeted to a single age group but instead for anyone who is willing or interested to learn a new hobby or skill

So how did we come up with this idea?
We noticed that for the past few years, where we had to stay at home due to COVID, that we were given a lot of time to ourselves. 
Whether it be starting a new exercise routine or getting back into reading, we had a lof of time on our hands
This inspired us to take on an educational sort of view on this project but instead of taking on topics like Mathemathics or Science, we decided to take a less serious approach and instead do
something that anyone of any age can also enjoy

As for our website design, 
We wanted to take a more game like theme to make our website more enjoyable and comical 
For the design of our logo, we designed it around our name Sprucelings.
With our more playful design choice, with the bright greens and smiling faces, we wanted to attract users and make our page mroe inviting.
Compared to the standard educational websites, they are usually monochrome and dull in color as to appeal to their adult audience whom are there to learn serious topics
