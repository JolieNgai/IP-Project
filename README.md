Design Process:
Our main idea is to create a educational website where users are able to learn and pick up basic knowledge of certain hobbies.
Our website is not targeted to a single age group but instead for anyone who is willing or interested to learn a new hobby or skill

So how did we come up with this idea?
We noticed that for the past few years, where we had to stay at home due to COVID, that we were given a lot of time to ourselves. 
Whether it be starting a new exercise routine or getting back into reading, we had a lof of time on our hands
This inspired us to take on an educational sort of view on this project but instead of taking on topics like Mathemathics or Science, we decided to take a less serious approach and instead do
something that anyone of any age can also enjoy

As for our website design, 
We wanted to take a more game like theme to make our website more enjoyable and comical 
For the design of our logo, we designed it around our name Sprucelings.
With our more playful design choice, with the bright greens and smiling faces, we wanted to attract users and make our page mroe inviting.
Compared to the standard educational websites, they are usually monochrome and dull in color as to appeal to their adult audience whom are there to learn serious topics 

Features :
1. Tutorial videos
   Sprucelings(users) can click on them to watch and learn more about that particular hobby
   Additionally, below the videos, there is a progress bar showing how far they've come for that particular level
   This is to indicate to users the progress they've made 
   
2. Leaderboards, 
   For Sprucelings to vote for their favourite projects that other users have completed

3. Feedback page
   We have included a BUG page where users can tell us if they have faced any problems while using our website 
   Moreover, we have an IDEAS page where users can key in suggestions that they have that we can implement into our website in the future

4. Achievements
   When a Spruceling completes a Level 1, 
   they will be awarded an accomplishment title.
   This is so as to encourage users to continue on and pursue they're selected hobby

5. News
   A page dedicated to talking about news/information related to that particular hobby(E.g Local crocheting business just opens)
   This is to keep Sprucelings interested in the different hobbies and potentially teach them more knowledge or informationa bout that particular hobby

6. Login pages
   Sprucelings firstly have to enter their email, name and some other particulars to create an account for themselves
   For new Sprucelings, they will enter their email, username, password, date of birth and choose a profile picture to create an account while
   Sprucelings who want to login to their existing account will just need to enter their username and password

7. Events
